MicroRNA Automated Adaptor Trimming

There are a lots of good adaptor trimming
programs out there. But I need a tool
to remove adaptors from a large number of
miRNA libraries and I have no idea
what kind of adaptors can be found there.

The goal of this program is to easy to
use, has minimal number of parameters.

This program won't deal with adaptor
contamination. It is expects that every
sequence reads contains adaptor (Mostly at
3' end).

This program won't deal with quality
scores. If you need quality based
trimming, use Trimmomatic, cutadapt, etc.

If you do not want to cut adaptor, but
you would like to identify it, this is
the right tool for you.

If you want to cut adaptor, but you
do not know the adaptor sequence itself,
this is also the right tool.

Thank you.
